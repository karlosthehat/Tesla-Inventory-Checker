BEFORE RUNNING THIS, PLEASE GO TO https://github.com/karlosthehat/Tesla-VIN-checker AND FOLLOW STEPS 1 AND 2, THEN COME BACK HERE:

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
1.) GO TO TESLA INVENTORY AND CUSTOMISE YOUR SEARCH PARAMETERS EXACTLY. IT MUST DISPLAY NO RESULTS (VERY IMPORTANT OR THIS WON'T WORK)
2.) ONCE DONE, COPY THE LINK AND PASTE IN LINK FIELD IN THE CODE. IT IS PRE LOADED FOR MODEL Y GOLD COAST QLD
3.) IF DESIRED, SIGN UP TO PUSHBULLET ($5 fee) TO HAVE NOTIFICATIONS SENT TO YOUR DEVICE
4.) WHEN YOU HAVE THEM, INSERT TOKEN AND USER DATA INTO RELEVANT FIELDS
5.) REMOVE "#" FROM CODE TO ENABLE PUSH NOTIFICATIONS
6.) RUN CODE AND ENJOY :)

NOTES:
*YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE LINK ABOVE FIRST AND INSTALL THE PACKAGES OR THIS WON'T WORK.
*THIS IS A VERY DUMB SCRIPT THAT SIMPLY CHECKS IF ANY RESULTS ARE RETURNED AND THEN SENDS YOU A NOTIFICATION, THEREFORE IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONFIGURE YOUR SEARCH PARAMETERS TO EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.
*I RECOMMEND YOU USE PUSHBULLET SO YOU CAN SET AND FORGET. IT COSTS $5 PER DEVICE.
*PLEASE DON'T FLOOD THE TESLA SITE WITH TOO MANY REQUESTS. I PRE-CONFIGURED FOR ONCE EVERY 10 MINUTES.
*USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
